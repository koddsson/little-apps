# little-apps
A directory of small web apps that I've been tinkering with. Note that these are probably all works in progress or broken. Feel free to open up PRs or issues with bug reports and feature requests. PRs are more likely to be accepted but I might also not want features that you want. In that case I'd advise you to run your own fork. Since all these deploy to GitHub pages it should be easy to get your fork up and running.

## Apps

- [Big Text](https://koddsson.github.io/big-text) makes text big on your screen. It's supposed to be useful when you need to leave messages for a coworker while screen sharing. Also useful for writing text on a mobile device to communicate in load places such as concerts.
- [Picker](https://koddsson.github.io/picker) is a re-implementation of a iOS app that I have installed on my phone. Given multiple touch inputs on the screen, the app will choose one of the inputs at random. Useful for picking who goes first in a board game or who gets to decide what we get for dinner.
- [RSS Reader](https://koddsson.github.io/rss-reader) is a pretty simple RSS reader that doesn't have a backend but only stores data in the browser. Doesn't have a lot of fancy features but is just simple and nice.
