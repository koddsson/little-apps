# little-apps
A directory of small web apps that I've been tinkering with.

## Apps

- [Big Text](https://koddsson.github.io/big-text) makes text big on your screen. It's supposed to be useful when you need to leave messages for a coworker while screen sharing. Also useful for writing text on a mobile device to communicate in load places such as concerts.
- [Picker](https://koddsson.github.io/picker) is a re-implementation of a iOS app that I have installed on my phone. Given multiple touch inputs on the screen, the app will choose one of the inputs at random. Useful for picking who goes first in a board game or who gets to decide what we get for dinner.
- [RSS Reader](https://koddsson.github.io/rss-reader) is a pretty simple RSS reader that doesn't have a backend but only stores data in the browser. Doesn't have a lot of fancy features but is just simple and nice.
